One more thing …
I'll have to swiftly ask a question about my Modest Proposal,
to the bach.ece.jhu.edu [http://bach.ece.jhu.edu/] guy and others (there's a bit of double entendre there) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse#Types_of_context_collapse].

Under the assumption that bad habits are hard to break, and you really want to write a potbox [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHW1I8T0caI], the current bias is something like the ostinato [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtFMxFQrKc4] to that passacaglia [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM].

So it doesn't really make sense to specify the Iref outputs at this time (i.e. in the next 5 hours),
but to be ready to provide the ibias input required by almost all the other building blocks (with the notable exception of the rheostat) in something like 50 nA elements,
say, for example, {6,7,23}*I_element [https://www.flickr.com/gp/89067995@N00/M8iV29m5H9],
as in
"these reference currents have been brought to you by the elements C, N, and V"
where the nominally 50 nA I_element may track g_m instead of an absolute value.

Do I still need to make up a more explicit specification of the current bias outputs (by the way, source or sink?) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcTVkOzrzQs&t=591s], to tickle an audience with longer ears than Gert Cauwenberghs, his first PhD, or the local Nobility?

When the chips are down [https://video.ethz.ch/speakers/lecture/5ec758e1-3d99-442e-a918-d4d9402cbac7.html], the current bias needs to provide I_{ref,source} and I_{ref,sink} to everyone else,
chaconne à son goût, quod libet [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqqAij9p0YU].

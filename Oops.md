# One more thing &hellip;

I'll have to swiftly ask a question about my *Modest Proposal*,  
to the **bach.ece.jhu.edu** [[http://bach.ece.jhu.edu/]([http://bach.ece.jhu.edu/])] 
guy and others  
(there's a bit of double entendre there) [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_collapse)].

Under the assumption that bad habits are hard to break, and you really want to write a potbox [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHW1I8T0caI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHW1I8T0caI)], the  

## current bias  

is something like the ostinato [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtFMxFQrKc4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtFMxFQrKc4)]  
to that passacaglia [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7QLM)].

So it doesn't really make sense to specify the I<sub>ref</sub> outputs at this time,  
but to be ready to provide the I<sub>bias</sub> input required by almost all the other building blocks  
(with the notable exception of the rheostat)  
in something like 50 nA elements,  
say, for example, {6,7,23}&times;I<sub>element</sub> [[https://www.flickr.com/gp/89067995@N00/M8iV29m5H9](https://www.flickr.com/gp/89067995@N00/M8iV29m5H9)], as in  
***"these reference currents have been brought to you by the elements C, N, and V"***  
where the nominally 50 nA I<sub>element</sub> may track g<sub>m</sub> instead of an absolute value.

Do I still need to make up a more explicit specification of the current bias outputs  
(by the way, source or sink?) [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcTVkOzrzQs&t=591s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcTVkOzrzQs&t=591s)],  
to tickle an audience with longer ears than Gert Cauwenberghs, his first PhD, or the local Nobility?

When the chips are down [[https://video.ethz.ch/speakers/lecture/5ec758e1-3d99-442e-a918-d4d9402cbac7.html](https://video.ethz.ch/speakers/lecture/5ec758e1-3d99-442e-a918-d4d9402cbac7.html)],  
the current bias needs to provide I<sub>ref,source</sub> and I<sub>ref,sink</sub> to everyone else,  
chaconne à son goût, quod libet [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqqAij9p0YU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqqAij9p0YU)].
